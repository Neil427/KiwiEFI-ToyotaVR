Note1: This LM1815 design is not a universal VR conditioner, the components are optimised for the pulse rate of the 24 / 1 tooth rates. 
Other pulse rates will require changes to the input filtering, one shot, and peak detector components.

Note2: V0.1 Gerbers are the original version V1.0 Gerbers have silkscreen update only.
